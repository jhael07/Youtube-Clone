## Overview

This project is a simplified YouTube clone built with Vite, using the RapidAPI YouTube Alternative V3 API for fetching video data. Inline Tailwind CSS is employed for styling, and React Router 6 ensures smooth navigation.

## Features

- **RapidAPI YouTube Alternative V3 API**: Fetch video data, including titles, thumbnails, and more.
- **Inline Tailwind CSS**: Directly integrate Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
- **React Router 6**: Dynamic and declarative routing for a seamless user experience.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd youtube-clone
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your RapidAPI key:
